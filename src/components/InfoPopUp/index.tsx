          <p>Listen to the intro, then find the correct Homestuck song in the list. This game currently takes songs from the official albums on weekdays, and a few popular fanmusic/unofficial albums on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
        </Styled.Section>
        <Styled.Section>
          <p>Incorrect attempts unlock more parts of the song, and tell you if you got the artist, album or theme right:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Song:</b> The game ends if you get this right, otherwise it&apos;ll show up <span className="red">red</span>.</li>
            <li><b>Artist:</b> <span className="green">Green</span> if you got them all right. If one or more of the contributors are correct, it&apos;ll be <span className="yellow">yellow</span>, <span className="red">red</span> if none did.</li>
            <li><b>Album:</b> <span className="green">Green</span> if you got it right, <span className="red">red</span> if you didn&apos;t.</li>
            <li><b>Theme:</b> If one of more of the art tags (characters or locations that appear in the art) of your guess are in the final song, it&apos;ll be <span className="yellow">yellow</span>, <span className="green">green</span> if they&apos;re all in the true song, <span className="red">red</span> if none are.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you&apos;re stuck, the skip button (or an empty guess) will submit a random song from the soundtrack.</p>
